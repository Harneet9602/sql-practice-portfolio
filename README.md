# SQL Practice Portfolio

This repository contains my hand-written SQL practice queries, structured and organized while solving problems from **SQLZoo** and **sql-practice.com**.

The goal of this project is to build a strong, interview-ready foundation in SQL, progressing from basic `SELECT` statements to advanced joins, subqueries, and analytical logic.

All queries are written by me, grouped by topic and difficulty, and documented for clarity.


## Repository Structure

### SQLZoo

Queries are organized by dataset and concept, moving from beginner to advanced.

| File | Topic |
|------|------|
| 01-select-world.sql | Basic SELECT, WHERE, filtering, patterns |
| 02-select-nobel-prize.sql | Conditional selection, ordering, text filtering |
| 03-world-subqueries.sql | Subqueries, nested logic, comparative filtering |
| 04-sum-count-world.sql | Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING) |
| 05-joins-football.sql | Multi-table joins (football match dataset) |
| 06-joins-movies.sql | Complex joins across movies, actors, casting |
| 07-using-nulls.sql | NULL handling, COALESCE, CASE, outer joins |
| 08-selfjoins-route.sql | Self joins, route connectivity, multi-hop queries |

### sql-practice.com

Focused on healthcare-style relational data with increasing query complexity.

| File | Topic |
|------|------|
| 01-patients.sql | Core SELECTs, filtering, joins, aggregations |
| 02-patients-advanced.sql | Subqueries, conditional logic, analytics-style problems |

Datasets used:
- patients
- admissions
- doctors
- province_names


## What This Demonstrates

- Strong understanding of relational databases
- Ability to:
  - write clean and readable SQL
  - reason through joins and self-joins
  - use aggregates correctly (WHERE vs HAVING)
  - handle NULL values safely
  - solve real, logic-driven SQL problems
- Queries are organized and progressively structured, similar to how SQL is used in real analysis and reporting work


## Tools and Environment

- SQL dialect: Standard SQL (SQLZoo and sql-practice.com)
- Practice platforms:
  - https://sqlzoo.net/
  - https://www.sql-practice.com/
- Focus on query logic, not database setup
- Queries tested directly on the platforms


## Notes

- This repository focuses on problem-solving rather than CREATE TABLE scripts
- Comments are included to explain the intent of queries
- File numbering reflects learning progression, not difficulty alone
