# SQL Practice Portfolio (SQLZoo)

This repository contains my **hand-written SQL practice queries**, structured and organized while solving problems from **SQLZoo**.  
The goal of this project is to build a **strong, interview-ready foundation in SQL**, progressing from basic `SELECT` statements to advanced joins and self-joins.

All queries are written by me, grouped by topic and difficulty, and documented for clarity.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each file focuses on **one dataset / concept**, moving from beginner to advanced queries:

| File | Topic |
|----|----|
| `01-select-world.sql` | Basic `SELECT`, `WHERE`, filtering, patterns |
| `02-select-nobel-prize.sql` | Conditional selection, ordering, text filtering |
| `03-world-subqueries.sql` | Subqueries, nested logic, comparative filtering |
| `04-sum-count-world.sql` | Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`) |
| `05-joins-football.sql` | Multi-table joins (football match dataset) |
| `06-joins-movies.sql` | Complex joins across movies, actors, casting |
| `07-using-nulls.sql` | `NULL` handling, `COALESCE`, `CASE`, outer joins |
| `08-selfjoins-route.sql` | Self joins, route connectivity, multi-hop queries |

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates

- Strong understanding of **relational databases**
- Ability to:
  - write clean and readable SQL
  - reason through joins and self-joins
  - use aggregates correctly (`WHERE` vs `HAVING`)
  - handle `NULL` values safely
  - solve real logic-based SQL problems
- Queries are **organized, explained, and progressively structured**, similar to how SQL is used in real analysis work

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- SQL dialect: **Standard SQL (SQLZoo)**
- Datasets: `world`, `nobel`, `game`, `goal`, `eteam`, `movie`, `actor`, `casting`, `teacher`, `dept`, `stops`, `route`
- Queries tested directly on **SQLZoo**

---

## 📌 Notes

- This repository focuses on **query logic**, not database setup (`CREATE TABLE`).
- Comments are included to explain the **intent** of each query.
- File numbering reflects **learning progression**, not difficulty alone.

## ✨ Next Steps

- Apply SQL skills to real datasets (CSV / databases)
- Integrate SQL with Python for analysis workflows
- Continue practicing query optimization and window functions
